        <p>To Princess Andy🤍<br>I hope this finds you well and happy on this special day!<br>
            Not gonna the distance is killing me, but <br>
            They say distance means nothing,<br>
            Then you are truly special to me,<br>
            Though you are not near, I feel you close,<br>
            You are in my mind, in every inch,<br>
            Through every call, and text,<br>
            You're in my heart, no matter what's next,<br>
            I know we both have major doubts about this distance thing<br>
            And, till were no longer miles apart, <br>
            Until that day, i will stay try to give you the best princess treatment ever<br>
            I don't care what others might say about long distance relationships but my heart will stay<br>
            Because when you are in front, i go deaf.<br>
            Through changing seasons, come what may<br>
            I'll stand besides you, no matter what happens.<br>
            I fell for you the moment I saw you!, and I'm still falling for your smile every day.<br>
            One of my biggest regrets right now is not actually kissing you when i had the chance</p>
